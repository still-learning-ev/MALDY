# JSON REPORT PREPROCESSING

#### JSON preproessor will be used to parse and clean the behavioural report genertaed by the Cuckoo Sandbox

###### Steps involved are:
- Fetch the JSON report from the cuckoo
- Convert JSON to the string format removing all the punctuations lines 
- Create a dataset from the above cleaned data in the CSV format(automatically or manually)
- Label the data (malnually or automatically)

Manually adding the labels and data to a CSV file using Notepad++ is better and using the seprator @ between the data and the label is good and is used in this file
